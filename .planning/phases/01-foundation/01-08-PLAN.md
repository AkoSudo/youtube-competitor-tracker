  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 1 Foundation:
    - Vite + React + TypeScript project
    - Tailwind CSS with YouTube dark theme
    - Supabase integration with real-time subscriptions
    - Channel CRUD with URL parsing
    - Responsive channel grid
    - Toast notification system
    - Navigation between Channels and Ideas pages
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Pre-requisites:**
    1. Ensure Supabase project exists and migration SQL has been run
    2. Ensure .env.local has valid Supabase credentials
    3. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173

    **Test 1: URL Format Support (REQ-CH-001)**
    Try adding channels with each format:
    - `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA` (channel ID)
    - `https://youtube.com/@MrBeast` (handle)
    - `https://youtube.com/c/PewDiePie` (custom URL)
    - `UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA` (raw ID)
    Expected: Each should add successfully with toast confirmation

    **Test 2: Invalid URL Handling (REQ-CH-007)**
    Try adding:
    - `not-a-url`
    - `https://vimeo.com/user123`
    - `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` (video URL, not channel)
    Expected: Error toast appears for each

    **Test 3: Duplicate Prevention (REQ-CH-006)**
    Try adding the same channel URL twice
    Expected: Error toast "This channel is already being tracked"

    **Test 4: Responsive Grid (REQ-CH-002)**
    - Desktop (>1280px): Should show 4 columns
    - Laptop (1024-1280px): Should show 3 columns
    - Tablet (640-1024px): Should show 2 columns
    - Mobile (<640px): Should show 1 column
    Use browser DevTools to resize and verify

    Verify each card shows:
    - Thumbnail or placeholder (88x88)
    - Channel name
    - Subscriber count (or "Hidden")
    - "Added [date]" text

    **Test 6: Delete with Confirmation (REQ-CH-004)**
    - Hover over a channel card
    - Click the delete (trash) icon
    - Confirm dialog should appear
    - Click "Cancel" - dialog closes, channel remains
    - Click delete icon again, click "Delete"
    - Channel should be removed from grid
    - Toast should confirm deletion

    **Test 7: Real-time Sync (REQ-CH-005)**
    Open the app in two browser tabs:
    - Add a channel in Tab 1
    - Verify it appears in Tab 2 within 2 seconds
    - Delete the channel in Tab 2
    - Verify it disappears from Tab 1 within 2 seconds

    **Test 8: Dark Theme (REQ-UI-001)**
    Verify:
    - Background is #0f0f0f (very dark)
    - Cards are #272727 (dark gray)
    - Text is readable (#f1f1f1 primary, #aaaaaa secondary)
    - Consistent across all pages

    **Test 9: Navigation (REQ-UI-006)**
    - Click "Ideas" in nav - goes to /ideas
    - Click "Channels" in nav - goes to /
    - Active page has highlighted background
    - (Ideas count badge will be 0 until Phase 3)

    **Test 10: Toast Notifications (REQ-UI-004)**
    Verify toasts appear for:
    - Successful channel add (green)
    - Invalid URL (red)
    - Duplicate channel (red)
    - Successful delete (green)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    After testing, respond with one of:
    - "approved" - all tests pass, proceed to Phase 2
    - List any failing tests with descriptions for fix plans
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>
