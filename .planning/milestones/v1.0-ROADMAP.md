## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite (faster than PostCSS)
- Public RLS policies for v1 (no auth requirement)
- Native dialog element for modals (browser accessibility)
- 180-second Shorts threshold (safety margin)
- 24-hour cache TTL (quota management)
- motion-safe:animate-pulse for accessibility

**Issues Resolved:**

- Handle resolution for @username URLs (added forHandle API support)
- Videos table creation (manual SQL after db push failed)
- TypeScript error type guard for ErrorBoundary

**Issues Deferred:**

- User authentication (v2 scope)
- Mobile app (web-first approach)
- Analytics dashboard (out of scope)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — all plans executed cleanly.
