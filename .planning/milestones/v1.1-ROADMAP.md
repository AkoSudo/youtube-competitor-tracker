# Milestone v1.1: Analytics Dashboard

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-26 (Restructured)
**Phases:** 5-9
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

v1.1 originally added analytics capabilities to help users spot content opportunities through competitor performance patterns. The milestone included a dedicated Analytics page with channel overview cards, video sorting and time filtering, upload frequency and duration charts, and polish.

**Post-Completion Restructuring:** After shipping, the user requested moving analytics to the Channel Detail page. The dedicated Analytics page was removed, and key features (Upload Frequency Chart, Top 5 Performing Videos) were integrated into the Channel Detail page.

1. User can view day-of-week upload frequency chart showing which days competitors post most
2. User can toggle between combined frequency (all channels) and single-channel filter
3. User can view scatter plot of video duration vs views with hover details (title, channel)
4. Scatter plot includes visual indicator of average duration
5. Charts use accessible colors on dark theme and are readable on mobile

1. All charts have proper axis labels and legends
2. User can see data freshness indicator showing when data was last fetched
3. Empty chart states display helpful messaging (not blank or zero-filled charts)
4. Chart animations respect prefers-reduced-motion setting

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Create usePrefersReducedMotion hook and DataFreshnessIndicator component
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Polish charts with axis labels, empty states, motion control, and integrate freshness indicator

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Use Recharts for charting (selected over Chart.js for better React integration)
- Client-side analytics computation (no database changes needed)
- Session storage for filter state persistence
- Move analytics to Channel Detail page (post-completion restructuring)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Recharts TypeScript tooltip types required TooltipContentProps instead of TooltipProps
- Import paths required relative imports (../../lib/) not @/ path alias

**Issues Deferred:**
- Combined analytics across all channels (removed in restructuring)
- Duration scatter chart analysis (removed in restructuring)
- Video sorting controls (removed in restructuring)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None - orphaned code was cleaned up during restructuring

**Post-Completion Restructuring (2026-01-26):**
The user requested moving analytics from a dedicated page to the Channel Detail page. This resulted in:
- Removed: AnalyticsPage, ChannelOverviewCard/Grid, DurationScatterChart, SortFilterControls, useSessionState, DataFreshnessIndicator
- Retained: UploadFrequencyChart (moved to ChannelDetailPage), usePrefersReducedMotion, chartUtils (frequency only)
- Added: Top 5 Performing Videos section with time filter on ChannelDetailPage
