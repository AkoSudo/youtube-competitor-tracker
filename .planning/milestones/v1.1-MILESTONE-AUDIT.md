# v1.1 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.1 Analytics Dashboard
**Audited:** 2026-01-26T18:00:00Z
**Status:** GAPS FOUND (Intentional Restructuring)

## Executive Summary

The v1.1 milestone was **intentionally restructured** after completion. The user requested moving analytics to the Channel Detail page and removing the dedicated Analytics page. This resulted in:

- **25 requirements no longer satisfied** (features intentionally removed)
- **8 requirements satisfied** (features retained or adapted)
- **5 orphaned components/functions** (dead code to clean up)

This is NOT a failure - it's a scope change. The original v1.1 was completed and verified, then intentionally modified.

## What Was Changed

### Removed Components

| Component | Phase | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `/analytics` route | 5 | User requested analytics on channel detail |
| `AnalyticsPage.tsx` | 5 | Replaced by channel-specific analytics |
| `AnalyticsPageSkeleton.tsx` | 5 | No longer needed |
| Analytics NavLink | 5 | Navigation simplified |
| `ChannelOverviewCard.tsx` | 6 | Channel metrics not needed |
| `ChannelOverviewGrid.tsx` | 6 | Channel metrics not needed |
| `ChannelOverviewCardSkeleton.tsx` | 6 | No longer needed |
| `DurationScatterChart.tsx` | 8 | Duration analysis not needed |

### Retained/Adapted Features

| Feature | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| UploadFrequencyChart | ChannelDetailPage | Working - shows channel's upload patterns |
| Top 5 Performing Videos | ChannelDetailPage | NEW - with time filter (7d/30d/90d/all) |
| usePrefersReducedMotion | UploadFrequencyChart | Working - respects motion preference |
| Chart axis labels | UploadFrequencyChart | Working - has proper labels |
| Chart empty states | UploadFrequencyChart | Working - shows helpful messages |

## Requirements Coverage

### Satisfied (8/33)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| FREQ-01 | Satisfied | Upload frequency as day-of-week distribution (on channel detail) |
| FREQ-02 | Satisfied | Shows which days channel uploads most |
| FREQ-05 | Satisfied | Accessible colors on dark theme |
| POLI-01 | Partial | Axis labels on frequency chart (scatter chart removed) |
| POLI-03 | Partial | Empty states on frequency chart (scatter chart removed) |
| POLI-04 | Satisfied | Motion preference respected |
| TIME-01 | Partial | Time period filter exists on Top 5 section only |
| TIME-04 | Partial | Visual indicator for selected time period |

### Not Satisfied - Intentionally Removed (25/33)

| Requirement | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| ANLY-01 | Analytics page removed |
| ANLY-02 | Analytics page removed |
| ANLY-03 | Analytics page removed |
| ANLY-04 | Analytics page removed |
| CHAN-01 | Channel overview cards removed |
| CHAN-02 | Channel overview cards removed |
| CHAN-03 | Channel overview cards removed |
| CHAN-04 | Channel overview cards removed |
| CHAN-05 | Channel overview cards removed |
| SORT-01 | Video sorting controls removed |
| SORT-02 | Video sorting controls removed |
| SORT-03 | Video sorting controls removed |
| SORT-04 | Video sorting controls removed |
| SORT-05 | Video sorting controls removed |
| TIME-02 | Default 30d applies to Top 5 only |
| TIME-03 | Time filter doesn't apply to "all analytics" |
| TIME-05 | Video count within period not shown |
| FREQ-03 | Combined frequency across channels not available |
| FREQ-04 | Channel filter on frequency chart removed |
| DURA-01 | Duration scatter chart removed |
| DURA-02 | Duration scatter chart removed |
| DURA-03 | Duration scatter chart removed |
| DURA-04 | Duration scatter chart removed |
| DURA-05 | Duration scatter chart removed |
| POLI-02 | Data freshness indicator not integrated |

## Phase Status

| Phase | Original Status | Current Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 5: Foundation | Complete | NOT APPLICABLE | Analytics page removed |
| Phase 6: Channel Overview | Complete | NOT APPLICABLE | Cards removed |
| Phase 7: Video Analytics | Complete | ORPHANED | Components exist but unused |
| Phase 8: Charts | Complete | PARTIAL | Only frequency chart remains |
| Phase 9: Polish | Complete | PARTIAL | Only motion hook active |

## Integration Check

### Working Connections (3/3)

1. **UploadFrequencyChart → chartUtils**: transformToFrequencyData connected
2. **UploadFrequencyChart → usePrefersReducedMotion**: Motion control connected
3. **ChannelDetailPage → UploadFrequencyChart**: Chart renders with video data

### E2E Flows (2/2)

1. **Channel Detail with Chart**: User clicks channel → videos load → frequency chart renders
2. **Top 5 with Time Filter**: User selects period → list filters → top videos shown

### No Broken Flows

All navigation and data flows are complete. Removed features were cleanly deleted.

## Tech Debt / Orphaned Code

The following code exists but has no consumers:

### Files to Delete

```
src/components/DataFreshnessIndicator.tsx
src/components/SortFilterControls.tsx
src/hooks/useSessionState.ts
```

### Functions to Remove

In `src/lib/chartUtils.ts`:
- `transformToScatterData` function (lines 64-75)
- `ScatterData` type export (lines 20-26)

## Recommendations

### Option A: Accept Restructuring (Recommended)

1. Update REQUIREMENTS.md to reflect the new scope
2. Update ROADMAP.md to mark v1.1 as "restructured"
3. Delete orphaned code
4. Proceed to v1.2 planning

### Option B: Plan Gap Closure

If original v1.1 scope is still desired:
1. Create phases to restore analytics page
2. Re-integrate removed components
3. This would duplicate work already done

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

1. Keep current structure
2. Add specific features back as v1.2 items:
   - Duration scatter chart on channel detail
   - Data freshness indicator
   - Sorting controls for Recent Videos
