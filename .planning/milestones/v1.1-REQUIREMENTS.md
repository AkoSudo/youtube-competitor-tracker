## Milestone Summary

**Originally Shipped:** 33/33 requirements (100%)
**After Restructuring:** 8/33 requirements retained (24%)

**Adjusted Requirements:**
- TIME-01, TIME-02: Scope reduced to Top 5 section only
- FREQ-04: No longer applicable (chart is now per-channel by design)

**Dropped Requirements (intentional restructuring):**
- All ANLY-* requirements (dedicated Analytics page removed)
- All CHAN-* requirements (channel overview cards removed)
- All SORT-* requirements (video sorting controls removed)
- Some TIME-* requirements (global time filter removed)
- All DURA-* requirements (duration scatter chart removed)
- POLI-02 (data freshness indicator removed)

**Reason for Changes:**
User requested moving analytics to Channel Detail page instead of a dedicated Analytics page. This simplified the navigation and made analytics channel-specific rather than cross-channel.

**New Features Added (not in original requirements):**
- Top 5 Performing Videos section on Channel Detail page
- Time filter (7d/30d/90d/all) for Top 5 videos
